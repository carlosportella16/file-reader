## About
This project was developed to read a .xlsx file of Employees, validate the data and valid data for each employee, such as name, email, age, salary and department must be valid data. 
After verifying the data, it separates them into two lists, one with valid data and the other with invalid data, so that later these lists are written in two .txt files.
